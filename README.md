# Stress-Lysis: Human Stress Detection through Physical Activity

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project detects and analyzes **stress levels** in humans based on **physical activity** parameters such as **humidity**, **body temperature**, and **step count**. The dataset used for this project includes 2001 samples, providing insights into how a person's physical condition correlates with their stress level.

The project performs **three different classifications** of stress levels: **low stress**, **normal stress**, and **high stress**. Using this data, we aim to predict the stress level of individuals by evaluating their physical activity and physiological measurements.

## 🧩 Problem Description

The system predicts **stress levels** based on data related to **humidity**, **temperature**, and **step count**. By analyzing this data, the model classifies the stress level of an individual into one of the following categories:

- **Low Stress**
- **Normal Stress**
- **High Stress**

This project utilizes the dataset to provide a real-time stress level detection system based on the physical activity of the user, offering valuable insights into how physical activity correlates with stress.
